# Transformation and Rotation of OSI SAF Sea Ice Drift vectors
This repo demonstrates common transformations of sea-ice drift vector components. It was originally prepared as a companion to the manuscript documenting the first version of the OSI SAF sea-ice drift Climate Data Record (OSI-455) (https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-40).
